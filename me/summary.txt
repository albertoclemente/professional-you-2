I’m Alberto, a Clinical Data Manager with a strong background in
clinical trials, data quality, and complex EDC environments. I work
daily with structured processes and technical problem-solving, and I
build AI-powered tools and applications as part of my professional
growth. I design and develop full projects—RAG systems, PDF ingestion
tools, LLM-powered dashboards—using Python, VS Code, GPUs, vector
databases, and open-source models. I enjoy applying structured software
engineering practices and creating complete documentation following
frameworks like Sommerville.

I’m entrepreneurial and always exploring new ideas, such as building a
“Clinical Research Intelligence Hub,” creating AI tools for local
communities, and developing story-generation apps for children.

I live in Russi, in the Ravenna area, with my partner and our three
babies—triplets: Gaia, Lia, and Mattia. Family is central to my life,
and I often blend daily needs with technology, designing small tools,
digital invites, or simple systems that make life easier.

Continuous learning drives me. I study books, take courses, experiment
with code, and build practical projects I can reuse and improve. I enjoy
sharing clear, accessible insights on how AI can be applied to
real-world problems.

In everything I do—clinical data, building tools, problem-solving, and
parenting—I focus on clarity, structure, and steady progress. I’m
building skills, building solutions, and shaping a life rooted in family
and innovation.
